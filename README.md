Welcome to the JAVAROO UML Editor.

To be able to run the program, please follow these steps. 

1. Download java development kit from `https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/`

2. Install java development kit

3. For Windows computer users ensure that you have `JAVA_HOME` added to your system variables
   1. Locate the directory where the JDK is installed on your system and note down the path to this directory.

   2. Do one of the following:
      1. `Windows 7` – Right click My Computer and select Properties > Advanced
      2. `Windows 8` – Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings
      3. `Windows 10/11` – Search for Environment Variables then select Edit the system environment variables

   4. Click the Environment Variables button

   5. Under System Variables, click New

   6. In the Variable Name field, enter either:
            JAVA_HOME if you installed the JDK (Java Development Kit)
                  or
            JRE_HOME if you installed the JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

   7. In the Variable Value field, enter your JDK or JRE installation path.

   8. Click OK and Apply Changes as prompted
      Note: You'll need to close and re-open any command windows that were open before you made these changes,
      as there's no way to reload environment variables from an active command prompt. If the changes don't take
      effect after reopening the command window, restart Windows.

5. download the code from the repository from github at `https://github.com/harley-ewu/Javaroo.git`

6.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the downloaded code from github it should be a zipped file

7. Unzip the the file

8. Within the folder from the file you just unzipped, there will be another zipped file called `UMLDiagram-1.0.zip`

9. Unzip the folder `UMLDiagram-1.0.zip`

10. Go into the unzipped folder and click into the bin folder you'll then see two files:
    1. If you are using a Macintosh or a Linux Computer double click the file named `UMLDiagram`
    2. If you are using a Windows Computer double click the file named `UMLDiagram.bat`

11. Have fun with the JAVAROO UML Editor :)
