Javaroo Design Patterns


Memento : Undo/Redo
	class - UMLDiagram
	-> This class is responsible for creating snapshots of its current state and can later revert to these snapchats. Thus, this enables undo and redo functionality in our program.
	line/s - setMemento and createMemento methods 
	

Command : Undo/Redo
	class - AddClassCommand/RemoveClassCommand/etc
	-> These classes contain specific functionalities such as adding or removing a class. This allows for a more modular and organized approach for these actions.
	line/s - whole class 


Observer : Buttons of the GUI, and the refreshing of the diagram(s)
	class -
	line/s - 

Singleton : The Diagram
	class -
	line/s - 

Proxy : GUI copies the diagram instead of accessing it
	class -
	line/s -
